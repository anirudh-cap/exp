# Introduction

This boilerplate has been created to be used while creating new Capillary UI projects that use React. This boilerplate is the successor to the older `cap-react-starter` which used the `container/component` model. This new boilerplate is based on the principles of `atomic-design`.

# What's Included
With this boilerplate, we get the basic features working with one single functional route: [/product/dashboard](http://localhost:8000/product/dashboard). The route makes an API call to fetch a list of programs and displays that list in a table.
